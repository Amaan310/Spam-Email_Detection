# Spam-Email_Detection

Hello Everyone!!
This project involves building a spam email detection system using machine learning and deploying it as a web application with Streamlit. The dataset used for this project is the "spam.csv" dataset, which contains labeled emails classified as spam or ham (non-spam). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify and detect spam emails based on features extracted from the email content.

The project uses text processing techniques such as tokenization and CountVectorizer for feature extraction. The model is then trained using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes for email classification. Additionally, Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application where users can input their emails and get real-time classification results.
